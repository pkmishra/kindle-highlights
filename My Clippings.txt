LLMs are language models may be either autoregressive, autoencoding, or a combination of the two. Modern LLMs are usually based on the Transformer architecture (which we will use in this book), but can also be based on another architecture. The defining features of LLMs are their large size and large training datasets, which enable them to perform complex language tasks, such as text generation and classification, with high accuracy and with little to no fine-tuning.

the most pivotal work in neural networks in the last 50 years was the multi-volume Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) by David Rumelhart, James McClelland, and the PDP Research Group, released in 1986 by MIT Press. Chapter 1 lays out a similar hope to that shown by Rosenblatt: People are smarter than today’s computers because the brain employs a basic computational architecture that is more suited to deal with a central aspect of the natural information processing tasks that people are so good at.…We will introduce a computational framework for modeling cognitive processes that seems…closer than other frameworks to the style of computation as it might be done by the brain. The premise that PDP is using here is that traditional computer programs work very differently from brains, and that might be

a neural network is a particular kind of machine learning model, which fits right in to Samuel’s original conception. Neural networks are special because they are highly flexible, which means they can solve an unusually wide range of problems just by finding the right weights. This is powerful, because stochastic gradient descent provides us a way to find those weight values automatically.

Validation Set When you train a model, you must always have both a training set and a validation set, and you must measure the accuracy of your model only on the validation set. If you train for too long, with not enough data, you will see the accuracy of your model start to get worse; this is called overfitting.

Of the billions and billions of species of living thing that have existed since the dawn of time, most—99.99 percent—are no longer around. Life on Earth, you see, is not only brief but dismayingly tenuous. It is a curious feature of our existence that we come from a planet that is very good at promoting life but even better at extinguishing it.

On a diagram of the solar system to scale, with Earth reduced to about the diameter of a pea, Jupiter would be over a thousand feet away and Pluto would be a mile and a half distant (and about the size of a bacterium, so you wouldn’t be able to see it anyway). On the same scale, Proxima Centauri, our nearest star, would be almost ten thousand miles away. Even if you shrank down everything so that Jupiter was as small as the period at the end of this sentence, and Pluto was no bigger than a molecule, Pluto would still be over thirty-five feet away.
